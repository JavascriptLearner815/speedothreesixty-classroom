      <h2>The Concept of Negativity</h2>
      <p>Before you learn negativity, you need to know what negativity means! Negativity is an expression of criticism or viewing the worst circumstance. An example is shown below.</p>
      <blockquote><p>John felt negativity about the idea of venturing into the woods.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Why is negativity necessary? Because it gives the impression of something appearing menacing or peculiar. Therefore, negativity is useful for stressing the narrator's point-of-view in text-writing.</p>
      <p>Why do opinions matter? Because they can be transferred into essays that use logical explanations to support themself. Adding onto the example from before, we can support their opinion by including their facts. One simple example is shown below.</p>
      <blockquote><p>John felt negativity about the idea of venturing into the woods, since the area was known to have wolves feasting on the available fuel, which he believed left little for humans to eat and drink.</p></blockquote>
