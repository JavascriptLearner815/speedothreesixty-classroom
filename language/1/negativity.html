          <h2 id="concept">The Concept of Negativity</h2>
          <p>Before you learn negativity, you need to know what negativity means! Negativity is an expression of criticism or viewing the worst circumstance. An example is shown below.</p>
          <blockquote><p>John felt negativity about the idea of venturing into the woods.</p></blockquote>
          <p>Why is negativity necessary? Because it gives the impression of something appearing menacing (i.e. threatening) or peculiar (i.e. unusual). Therefore, negativity is useful for stressing the narrator's point-of-view in text-writing.</p>
          <p>Why do opinions matter? Because they can be transferred into essays that use logical explanations to support themselves. Adding onto the example from before, we can support their opinion by including their facts. One simple example is shown below.</p>
          <blockquote><p>John felt negativity about the idea of venturing into the woods, since the area was known to have wolves feasting on the available fuel, which he believed left little for humans to eat and drink.</p></blockquote>
          <details>
            <summary>Weltschmerz</summary>
            <div>
              <p>Weltschmerz is a very long-term and extremely sorrowful form of negativity. It is a whole other concept that will be explained in the next lesson. The definition is shown below.</p>
              <figure>
                <blockquote cite="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/">
                  <p>a feeling of melancholy and world-weariness.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption class="group group-1"></figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>The definition of the word melancholy is shown below.</p>
              <figure>
                <blockquote cite="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/">
                  <p>a feeling of pensive sadness, typically with no obvious cause.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption class="group group-1"></figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>The word pensive is another way to describe an intense or deep emotion.</p>
              <p>The definition of the word world-weary (which is the description of the aforementioned process from the definition of Weltschmerz) is shown below.</p>
              <figure>
                <blockquote cite="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/">
                  <p>feeling or indicating feelings of weariness, boredom, or cynicism as a result of long experience of life.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption class="group group-1"></figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>The word cynicism is a word to describe a natural tendency of motivation being created from self-interest and to not easily be convinced otherwise.</p>

          <h2 id="structure">Building Blocks</h2>
          <p>Learning negativity is its own thing. But you need to know the basic building blocks of the language before you start learning it! Below are some examples of what you will be using.</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Structure</summary>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li><p><a href="../../audio/language/ie" target="_blank"><dfn>Ie</dfn>: I, me, or the concept of focus on myself.</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="../../audio/language/oaq" target="_blank"><dfn>Oaq</dfn>: Loud and with repetitive, echoing audio feedback (e.g. presenting a Meet inside of itself, which creates audio feedback).</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="../../audio/language/al" target="_blank"><dfn>Al</dfn>: Unspeakably morbid (i.e. gruesome), queer (i.e. peculiar), or cruel (i.e. savage).</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="../../audio/language/pensmay" target="_blank"><dfn>Pensmay</dfn>: Dazed at the level of a vague mental sense of life (i.e. worrying about nothing, and barely being able to speak), especially because of a sudden change in direction of blood flow (e.g. being turned upside-down), or stir-crazy (i.e. unlike one's real self), typically aggressively (e.g. heated temper from distress after prolonged confinement).</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="../../audio/language/majioupvocalk" target="_blank"><dfn>Majioupvocalk</dfn>: Incredibly awesome, outstanding, and extraordinarily good (i.e. supercalifragilisticexpialidocious); wonderful.</a></p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Alternatively, you can <a href="../../audio/language/" target="_blank">go ahead and browse the entire language audio recordings library</a> for the same audio files and their definitions, all in one place, including ones from other language lessons.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <p>Now, let us put them together. In this first example, we will explore the difference in order of a noun and an adjective. Look at the descriptions below.</p>
          <p><dfn>Ie pensmay</dfn>: Severely dazed is like me.</p>
          <p><dfn>Pensmay ie</dfn>: I am severely dazed.</p>
          <p>As you can see, noun-adjective represents the adjective is <em>alike</em> to the noun, whereas adjective-noun represents the adjective <em>describing</em> the noun.</p>
